# ROB535 - Perception Project

Per Cade's wise suggestion, I have opted not to add all of the images, point clouds, etc. to this Repo. Please update the `data-2019/` folder locally. I have already set up the `.gitignore` to not commit these to our branch after you add them. Let me know if you have any issues after doing this.

You will notice two new files:
- `data-2019/trainval/trainval_labels.csv`
- `data-2019/trainval/trainval_centroids.csv`

They are identical to `labels.csv` and `centroids.csv`, but were added by running my modified version of `extract_info.py`. We can remove these from the Repo if people want, or add them to `.gitignore`.
